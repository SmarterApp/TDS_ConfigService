# TDS_ConfigService
## Overview
The `TDS_ConfigService` (aka Config Support Service) consists of two modules:

* **client:** Contains the POJOs/classes needed for a consumer to interact with the Config Support Service
* **service:** REST endpoints that provide TDS configuration data

## Build
To build the **client**:

* `mvn clean install -f /path/to/client/pom.xml`

To build the **service**:

* `mvn clean install -f /path/to/service/pom.xml`

To build the service and run integration tests:
  
* `mvn clean install -Dintegration-tests.skip=false -f /path/to/service/pom.xml`

### Docker Support
The Config Support Service provides a `Dockerfile` for building a Docker image and a `docker-compose.yml` for running a Docker container that hosts the service `.jar`.  For the following command to work, the Docker Engine must be installed on the target build machine.  Resources for downloading and installing the Docker Engine on various operating systems can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).  For details on what Docker is and how it works, refer to [this page](https://www.docker.com/what-docker).

To build the service and its associated Docker image:

* `mvn clean install docker:build -f /path/to/service/pom.xml`

## Run
### Run in IDE
To run the Config Support Service in the IDE, un-comment the properties defined in the `service/src/main/resources/application.properties` file and set them to appropriate values.

### Run .JAR
To run the compiled jar built by one of the build commands above, use the following:

```
java -Xms256m -Xmx512m \
    -jar /path/to/target/tds-config-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar \
    --server-port="8080" \
    --server.undertow.buffer-size=16384 \
    --server.undertow.buffers-per-region=20 \
    --server.undertow.io-threads=64 \
    --server.undertow.worker-threads=512 \
    --server.undertow.direct-buffers=true \
    --spring.datasource.url="jdbc:mysql://[db server name]:[db port]/configs" \
    --spring.datasource.username="[MySQL user name]" \
    --spring.datasource.password="[MySQL user password]" \
    --spring.datasource.type=com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource
```

### Run Docker Container
The Config Support Service requires several environment variables to be set prior to starting the `.jar`.  The environment variables are managed by an [environment file](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#/set-environment-variables-e-env-env-file), which Docker uses to set the appropriate environment variables.

To create the environment file:

* Navigate to where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located
* Create a new file named `config-service.env`
* Open `config-service.env` in an editor and set the following values:

```
CONFIGS_DB_HOST=[IP address or FQDN of the MySQL database server that hosts the TDS configs and session databases]
CONFIGS_DB_PORT=[The port on which the MySQL database server listens]
CONFIGS_DB_NAME=[The name of the TDS configs database (typically "configs")]
CONFIGS_DB_USER=[The MySQL user account with sufficient privileges to read from the configs and session databases]
CONFIGS_DB_PASSWORD=[The password for the MySQL user account]
```

* Example `config-service.env` file:

```
CONFIGS_DB_HOST=tds-mysql-instance.example.com
CONFIGS_DB_PORT=3306
CONFIGS_DB_NAME=configs
CONFIGS_DB_USER=tds_user
CONFIGS_DB_PASSWORD=protohorsecarbattery
```
**NOTE:**  Any file with a `.env` extension will _not_ be committed to source control; the `.gitignore` is set to exclude files with a `.env` extension.  Therefore, sensitive information stored in this file will not be committed.

After the `config-service.env` file is saved, run the Config Support Service Docker container with the following commands:
 
```
mvn clean install docker:build -f /path/to/service/pom.xml
docker-compose up -d -f /path/to/docker-compose.yml
```

#### Additional Details for Interacting With Docker
The `Dockerfile` included in this repository is intended for use with [Spotify's Docker Maven plugin](https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin).  As such, the `docker build` command will fail because it cannot find the compiled `.jar`.

The Docker container can be started via `docker-compose` or `docker run`:

* The command for starting the container via `docker-compose`:  `docker-compose up -d -f /path/to/docker-compose.yml`
  * **NOTE:** If `docker-compose` is run in the same directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located, `docker-compose up -d` is sufficient to start the container
* Alternately, `docker run` can be used to start up the container:  `docker run -d -p [open port on host]:8080 --env-file /path/to/config-service.env fwsbac/tds-config-service`
  * example:  `docker run -d -p 23571:8080 --env-file config-service.env fwsbac/tds-config-service`

To see the list of running Docker containers, use the following command:

* `docker ps -a`
* Output will appear as follows:
 
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                        COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                     NAMES
4b267a450d3b        fwsbac/tds-config-service   "/docker-startup.sh"   2 hours ago         Up 2 hours          0.0.0.0:23571->8080/tcp   docker_config_1
```
To tail the log files for the process(es) running on the Docker container:

* `docker logs -f [container id]`
  * **NOTE:**  To view the logs without tailing them, omit the `-f` from the command above
* example:  `docker logs -f 4b267a450d3b`

## Integration Test Notes
* Integration tests are not run during a typical Maven build
* To run integration tests during a build, refer to the **Build** section above

### Database Migrations
* The database migrations stored in `src/test/resources/db/migration` are only intended to support integration tests.  As such, they represent a small subset of the overall database schema for the `configs` and `session` databases.
* Database Migrations are only executed when the `failsafe` plugin is configured to run.  By default, `failsafe` is configured to skip running integration tests when Maven builds the project.
* [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/) is used to execute the database migrations against an H2 in-memory database before the integration tests are executed. 

### Naming Database Migration Files
* Naming database migration files uses the following convention (note there are two underscores between the timestamp and the database name):

V[***timestamp***]_\_[***database name***]\_[***DDL operation***]\_[***object name***].sql

* Example file name: `V1472923547__configs_create_table_client_systemflags.sql`
* To generate the timestamp, use [http://www.unixtimestamp.com/](http://www.unixtimestamp.com/) and copy the UTC timestamp

### Database Migrations Troubleshooting

#### Seed Data
* Loading data from a MySQL dump file into an H2 database requires some special handling:
  * Remove all backtick (`) characters from the SQL
  * Exported `BIT` columns must be updated:
      * Replace all `,'\0',` (non-printable `null` character) with `,0,`
      * Replace all `,'',` (non-printable character `u0001` [`SOH` or `START OF HEADER`]) with `,1,`  
      * ***NOTE:***  Take care when replacing the exported `BIT` columns.  It is possilbe the export also has empty `VARCHAR` fields, which might also be replaced by using the patterns above.
  * To handle MySQL `VARBINARY` values (e.g. the UUIDs used as primary keys):
      * In MySQL, use `HEX` to get the `VARBINARY` value in a readable format, e.g.: `SELECT HEX(_key), clientname FROM configs.client_externs;`
      * Copy the "expanded"/readable `VARBINARY` value
      * In the `INSERT... VALUES` statement that is inserting the `VARBINARY` value, use H2's `X(value)` function to properly convert the input, for example:

`INSERT INTO client_externs VALUES (X'1FEFBFBD54EFBFBDEFBFBD154BEFBFBD','MultiClient_RTS_2013','MultiClient_RTS_2013','itembank',1,1,'RTS','RTS',1,'session',1,1,'SBAC',1,'SBAC',NULL,'Development',0,0,NULL,100000,1,NULL,NULL);`
